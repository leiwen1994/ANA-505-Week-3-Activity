#How did the model do?
the script performs a thorough analysis of the Iris dataset using Support Vector Classification. It explores the data, visualizes the SVM model and decision boundaries, makes predictions, and calculates the missclassification rate. The visualization and analysis suggest that the model performs well, especially in distinguishing the Setosa species, while there's some overlap between Versicolor and Virginica. The calculated missclassification rate quantifies the extent of classification errors made by the model.
#What is the accuracy rate? SVM accuracy: 2.666667%

#How did the model do?
the script focuses on performing K-Means Clustering on the Iris dataset. It includes data preprocessing, applying the K-Means algorithm, visualizing the clusters, and calculating the accuracy of the clustering results. 
#What is the accuracy rate? K Means accuracy: 0%


#How did the model do?
Loads and explores the iris dataset.
Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
Builds a C5.0 decision tree model on the training data.
Predicts species for the test data and evaluates accuracy.
Creates a cross-tabulation table for detailed analysis.
#What is the accuracy rate? C50 accuracy:: 95.55556%
